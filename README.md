# Uber-Data-Engineering-Project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics pipeline for Uber data using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, Python, and Mage.ai. The pipeline extracts raw data from GCP Storage, processes it using Mage and Compute Engine, stores it in BigQuery, and visualizes insights with Looker Studio.
